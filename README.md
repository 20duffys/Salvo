##Description
Two simple games including a different version of battleship and a trivia game on Hamlet.

I am going to make a game of battleship which can be played by one or two people. Battleship is a game based on two players having two separate ten by ten grids. Each player places the locations of their four separate ships. The ships may be lined up horizontally or vertically on the grid, not diagonally. The four ships are: the battleship, which takes up four squares; the destroyer, which covers three squares; the cruiser, which covers three squares; and the submarine, which covers two squares. The goal of the game is to properly eliminate all of the opponents ships before they do the same to your ships.

I am also going to make a trivia game using Hamlet as the primary source material for questions. There will be twenty individual questions. Each player tries to answer the question. If player A is incorrect, then player B may try to answer that question. For each correct answer, the player receives a point. The winner is the person who receives the most points.
